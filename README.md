# [wip] RobôCIn Protocols 📦

The RobôCIn Protocols repository is a central hub dedicated to storing and managing protocols that are intended to be
shared across multiple projects. It serves as a reliable source of truth for the latest versions of the protocols
definitions, providing an organized directory structure that categorizes and documents each protobuf file, making it
simple for developers to navigate and understand the available data structures.

By centralizing protocols in a dedicated repository, the RobôCIn team promotes code reuse, modularity, and efficient
development practices. Any updates or modifications to the shared protocols can be made in a controlled manner, ensuring
compatibility across multiple repositories that depend on these protocols.

## About

### Protobufs

[Protobufs](https://protobuf.dev) are a language-agnostic data serialization format developed by Google, which allow for
efficient and structured communication between different software components. By maintaining a separate repository
solely for protobufs, the RobôCIn team ensures consistency, version control, and easy access to shared data structures
across various projects within the organization.
